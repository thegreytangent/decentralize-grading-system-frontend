## Introduction

This project aims to enhance the security and integrity of academic records by leveraging blockchain technology for grades encoding. By implementing a decentralized ledger, we ensure that academic records are tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible only to authorized parties. This ReadMe provides an overview of the project's features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and architectural details.

## Features

- **Decentralized Ledger:** Uses blockchain technology to store academic records securely.
- **Tamper-Proof:** Ensures that grades cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Transparency:** Provides a transparent record of all transactions related to academic records.
- **Access Control:** Restricts access to authorized users only.
- **Immutable Records:** Ensures the immutability of records once they are added to the blockchain.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (for local blockchain development)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/academic-records-blockchain.git
    cd academic-records-blockchain
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile smart contracts:**
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

4. **Migrate smart contracts to the blockchain:**
    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

5. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

### Adding a Grade

1. **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Log in as an authorized user:**
    Enter your credentials to access the grade encoding section.

3. **Add a grade:**
    Enter the student's ID, course ID, and grade, then submit the form. The grade will be encoded on the blockchain.

### Viewing Grades

1. **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Log in as an authorized user or student:**
    Enter your credentials to view grades.

3. **View grades:**
    Search for the student's ID or course ID to view the encoded grades.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **GradesContract:** Handles the encoding and retrieval of grades on the blockchain.
- **AccessControl:** Manages user permissions and roles.

### Frontend

- Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) for a responsive and interactive user interface.

### Backend

- Uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to handle API requests and interact with the blockchain.

## Security

- **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted before being stored on the blockchain.
- **Access Control:** Strict access control mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can add or view grades.
- **Auditing:** All transactions are logged and auditable to ensure transparency and accountability.
